# Booleans and Conditonals Recap

I create a series of small applications to practice and recap what I've learned. 

<b>Ask Java!</b>
- An application where the user can ask questions and Java needs to reply: true or false.
- Purpose is to practice writing comparisons that can return a boolean

<b>Javamart</b>
- Your taking your kids shopping at the Javamart! Your kids will ask you to buy toys for them
- If you have enough money, you'll go ahead and buy the toys for them. If you don't have enough money, you'll have to say no
- Purpose is to control how code runs using if statements

<b>The Quidditch Championship</b>

<i>"If Gryffindor beats Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points, they would win the championship. If they win by any number of points or tie, they would come second. If they lose by less than a hundred points, they come third behind Hufflepuff. If they lose by more than a hundred points, they would be in fourth place"</i>
- Application converts above passage from Harry Potter into code
- Purpose is to practice chaining a series of if - else if - else statements
